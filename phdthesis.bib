  abstract = {Abstract A model inter-comparison study to assess the abilities of steady-state Gaussian dispersion models to capture near-road pollutant dispersion has been carried out with four models (AERMOD, run with both the area-source and volume-source options to represent roadways, CALINE, versions 3 and 4, \{ADMS\} and RLINE). Two field tracer studies are used: the Idaho Falls tracer study and the Caltrans Highway 99 tracer study. Model performance measures are calculated using concentrations (observed and estimated) that are paired in time and space, since many of the health related questions involve outcomes associated with spatially and temporally distributed human activities. All four models showed an ability to estimate the majority of downwind concentrations within a factor of two of the observations. RLINE, AERMOD-V, and ADMS, also have the capability to predict concentrations upwind of the roadway that result from low-speed meandering of the plume. Generally, RLINE, ADMS, and \{AERMOD\} (both source types) had overall performance statistics that were broadly similar, while \{CALINE\} 3 and 4 both produced a larger degree of scatter in their concentration estimates. The models performed best for near-neutral conditions in both tracer studies, but had mixed results under convective and stable conditions. },

  abstract = {Traffic congestion is a significant issue in urban areas in the United States and around the world. Previous analyses have estimated the economic costs of congestion, related to fuel and time wasted, but few have quantified the public health impacts or determined how these impacts compare in magnitude to the economic costs. Moreover, the relative magnitudes of economic and public health impacts of congestion would be expected to vary significantly across urban areas, as a function of road infrastructure, population density, and atmospheric conditions influencing pollutant formation, but this variability has not been explored.},

Possible mechanisms underlying traffic jam formation and propagation are presented from a dynamical viewpoint. Stable and unstable motions are described that may give the skeleton of traffic dynamics, and the effects of driver behaviour are emphasized in determining the emergent state in a vehicular system. At appropriate points, references are provided to the papers published in the corresponding Theme Issue.},

  abstract      = {This paper introduces a new parameter to characterize the random component in temporal variability of atmospheric pollutants and proposes a simple statistical technique for its evaluation. That parameter is the net decay time (or the time scale) of the local anomalies in concentrations of atmospheric pollutants, rather than the traditionally used chemical lifetimes of total amounts of the species. Using widely available data of hourly multi-year surface trace gas pollutant concentrations we demonstrate a simplified way to estimate the net decay time with an exponential approximation of lag-correlation functions. We assessed the decay times of fluctuations in observations of eight atmospheric pollutants (SO2, NO, NO2, NOy, O3, CO, NH3, and HNO3) at two urban sites and one cleaner rural site in the Eastern US. The time scales of temporal fluctuations (net decay times) vary from about one hour to slightly more than one day. These scales are generally much shorter in urban environments than in remote regions. We also compared day- and night-time observations in warm and cold seasons. At night in the cold season, time scales of fluctuations in atmospheric pollutants are usually the longest. Such estimates should be useful to air quality prediction, public health, and satellite remote sensing research communities.},
